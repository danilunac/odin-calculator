# The Odin Project Calculator

Final project for the **Foundations** module of _The Odin Project_, where I applied what I’ve learned about:

- DOM manipulation  
- JavaScript logic  
- Event handling  
- Array methods to structure the logic of a calculator

Inspired by the retro design of the **Casio fx-17**
